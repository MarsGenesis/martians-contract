## ⭐️ What is it ?
The Martians is a collection of 10,000 unique 3D characters with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
The NFT contract that governs ownership is a standard ERC-721 that works with any compatible service or exchange.
Each Martian’s owner will be given access to an additional asset pack that includes the full 3D model of their character.

## ⭐️ How to get one ?
The Martians will come as a free mint (ETH fees may apply) to all Mars Genesis parcel owners who minted at least one parcel before October 15, 2021 @ 11:59 pm UTC.
After October 15, 2021, anyone will be able to mint a Martian for 0.08 ETH.

## ⭐️ Golden Martians
If you mint one of our 5 Golden Martians (with a solid gold skin), we will offer to buy it back (Only after the 10,000 martians are minted) at a floor price of
10 ETH
The Golden Martians are randomly distributed and you have an equal chance to mint one either for free or for 0.08 ETH after October 15.

## ⭐️ 40 crypto-factions
Each Martian will belong to a crypto-faction represented by one of the 40 most popular cryptocurrencies.
Want to show your support to your favorite crypto? How about using your Martian?

## ⭐️ The Battle of Martians
If you own a Martian, you can challenge another Martian from a different faction and win their Martian.
If the owner accepts, then the cryptocurrency that grows the most* (percentage wise) in the next 24 hours will give the victory to its Martian.

_e.g._
Martian #345 (DOGE) challenges Martian #6194 (BTC)
Martian #6194 accepts on December 12, 2021 at 4:23 pm UTC
After 24h, DOGE went down by 12.3% while BTC went down by 7.3%. BTC grew the most (or shrunk the least).
Martian #6194 (BTC) is therefore the winner
The winner will receive the NFT of the loser. In the above example, the owner of Martian #6194 will receive the NFT Martian #345.
Please be very cautious before challenging or accepting a challenge.
You may lose your NFT. Only the brave ones will conquer Mars. Fight, collect and grow your martian army.
